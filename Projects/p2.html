   <h2> My other personal value would be my kindness. To me being kind is one of the best values that someone can have and it also shows other people how caring they are. Being kind makes other people have a good impression of you and also makes you feel good about yourself. I believe myself to be a kind person since I try my best and don't try to get into arguements with other people. </h2>
